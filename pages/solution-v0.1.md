# Solution v0.1

**Assumptions**

1. The solution text may or may not be free of errors, given that it isn't final and the trailer says that the footage isn't final gameplay footage.
2. Given the degree to which Nintendo has waited to share details over fear of spoilers, it could be possible that characters were changed or removed.
3. Past alphabets in the Legend of Zelda series have particular rules that should be accounted for, such as:
   
  - **Hero of Time Hylian**: Based on a 46/71 Hiragana sounds. It's missing Dakuten and there are several piece of Hylian text of Ocarina of Time where you must change the transliterated text to it's Dakuten counterpart to make sense of it (i.e. Ka/Ga, Sa/Za, Ta/Da, Ha/Ba).
  - **Wind Waker Hylian**: Utilizes RIYA/I/O/E/U and RY/A/I/O/E/U interchangeably. There are also scenarios where "Rio" is used in place of "Ryu".
  - **Sky Era Hylian**: D/W, E/K, G/Q, I/X, O/Z, P/T letter pairs are interchangeable and the alphabet uses the same rune for both
  - **Lorulean Hylian**: D/G, E/W, F/R, J/T, O/Z letter pairs are interchangeable and the alphabet uses the same rune for both

**Rules**

1. For the most part, words should end with A, I, O, E, U, N *(and possibly 'ng' )*. Stem words can break this rule if the source was transliterated by someone without knowledge of the language.
   
2. If an error in the source is assumed, the step applied to "correct" it should be applied across the board for all errors of the type, to avoid injecting bias, hopes, and dreams into the solutions.

**Summary**

To understand large areas of this solution, please read up on the [rune inventory](/pages/rune-inventory.md) and [cipher text analsysis](/pages/wall-art-cipher-analysis.md) first.

# Process

1. Start with the key letter of the highest frequency *(in this case C or D)* and substitute a vowel or consonant from the pool of frequent characters and remove it from the pool once you've replaced all instances of the key letter.
   
2. Move on to the next key letter and perform step 1 again.

# Methodology

- Start with the left panel because it has the highest concentration of single letters, syllables, and digraphs
- Once a theoretical key starts to emerge, substitute key letters on the right panel to check if things emerge

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SONA = THAT WAY   | Sona shouldn't be at the beginning                                   |
| HI = DAY          | Hi could be the subject but still doesn't make sense to follow sona  |
| NI = TWO, TOWARDS | If Ni was "towards" it should be at the end of the sentence          |
| NAHU = NAME TAG   | Nahu being towards the middle could indicate it's a subject          |
| SOSO = NEAT       | Soso on its only maybe shouldn't go here, neatly could work          |
| NA = DONT         | Don't is an adjective, which would make Soso into Sosona which works |
|                   | This solution has too many issues to be right                        |

### Attempt 2

**Notes from last test**
- D=A and B = O can still work, C as N probably doesn't work so shift consonants

| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SO = Ancestor   | SO KAHI KI gets us towards subject-object                       |
| KAHI = Monument | Kahuso is a noun which could maybe relate to the object?        |
| KI = Spirit     | Ka being a noun doesn't work without a verb ending or adjective |
| KAHUSO = excess | Kah is not a stem word so this solution likely doesn't work     |
| KA = Lesson     |                                                                 |

### Attempt 3

**Notes from last test**
- D=A, B = O, C = K can still work, E = H likely isn't but since we got a subject and object last round, try moving consonants

| HOKA = Beyond         | KAS as a stem word implies KAS/U/I/E/A, KASHI, KASHITE depending on context |

### Attempt 4

**Notes from last test**
- D=A, B = O, C = K, A=H can still work, since the last solution started to reveal a lot better detail, lets keep everything but swap vowels around

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HIKA = Light          | We have light and ancestor which could be a great subject        |
| SO = Ancestor         | Koka or Kokasu are problematic in their location                 |
| KOKA = Solidify       | Hi could be the object                                           |
| KOKASU = Knock down   | Applying the ending KA with the stem word KAS (Kasu/i/e/o) works |
| HI = Day              | HIKA could be HI and KA as separate words                        |
| KAS = Godan Stem Word |                                                                  |

### Attempt 5

**Notes from last test**
- D=A, B = I, C = K, A=H feel like we are on the right track. This round try and shift E=C to something else. The next consonant in the pool is R

| HIKAR = Godan stem word | We have a stem word twice (Hikar) with is about light doing a thing |
| ROKO = Open             | This falls apart in the same places are others, by having SO or V   |
| KARU = Cut              |                                                                     |

### Attempt 6

**Notes from last test**

- D=A, B = I, C = K, A=H, E=R feel like we are on the right track. Try G = U since U is the next vowel and HIKARU would be grammatically correct since HIKARO isn't real. Since X is singular, lets re-introduce the S consonant since it has a high frequency normally

| HIKARU = Shine       | This feels startlingly close to something real                        |

**Notes from last text for left panel key**

- Substituting all from the left panel WIP key just to see if anything jumps out. Expect that S is a vowel based on cipher ending being ESR where E is a consonant. The next vowels should be either E or O because we're running out. O is more popular so try it first. Z is also likely a vowel since it's enclosed in two consonants. Try E. Next consonants are N and T. Y and R have the same frequency so try both next consonants. R is probably N since it would be weird to end on a T for situations like ESR, DBZ
